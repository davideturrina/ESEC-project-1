Oh, the night is my world
City life, painted girls
In a day, nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall, something breakin'
Wearin' white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul
You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes the story's told
You take my self you take my self control
Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You're makin' me forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control
Oh, the night is my world
City life, painted girls
In a day, nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes the story's told
You take my self you take my self control
Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You're makin' me forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control
I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow
So I guess I just believe it that this night will never go
Night, I'm livin' in a moment of a dream
I know that life is not as it would seem
I must believe in something
So I make myself believin' that this night will never go
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh
